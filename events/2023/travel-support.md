We encourage applications for travel support to SERPL from students anywhere in
the US. Student travel grants can support students and postdocs, from any US
university, regardless of citizenship or visa status.

In addition, we have set aside a portion of our student travel awards for
funding undergraduate students, women, underrepresented minorities, and LBGTQ+
people.

SERPL student travel support is graciously funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF).
