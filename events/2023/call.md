## Scope

SERPL scope is kept very broad in order to allow as many people to
contribute as possible, but the following is an incomplete list of
topics for SERPL related research:

- Implementation aspects of programming languages
- Software-Development Techniques
- Foundations of Programming Languages
- Software Analysis
- Applications of programming languages
- Domain-specific languages

The previous list of topics is not comprehensive, and if your topic
is not listed, then this should not prevent you from submitting your
talk abstract.
