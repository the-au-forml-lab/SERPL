## Parking

Paid parking is available at the GCC parking deck, and is across the entrance of the GCC. If it is possible we recommend leaving your car parked at your hotel, because there are a limited number of spaces, but if that is not possible then park at the GCC. 

Free street parking is usually also available nearby, on Broad street, and in Reynolds street area (5 - 10 min walk).

The GCC is to the left and the Marriot is to the right.   The enterance to the GCC -- the left-most endpoint -- is off of 11th street. There will be someone there greeting everyone before the start of the conference. The red path follows Reynolds street, and the green path follows the Augusta River Walk along the Savannah river.  The latter requires one to climb down a number of steps and so is not wheelchair accessible.
