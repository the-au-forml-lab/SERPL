title: The Southeast Regional Programming Languages Seminar 2023
---

<p class="lead">
The Southeast Regional Programming Languages Seminar (SERPL) seeks to
bring together researchers in the Southeastern United States working in 
the design, analysis, and application of programming languages to build 
new collaborations among students and researchers.
</p>

<p class="lead">
We invite contributions in the form of student -- both undergraduate
and graduate -- research talks on topics related to programming
language research from theory to practice to interdisciplinary
applications.
</p>

<p class="lead">
SERPL consists of a full day of research talks from undergraduate and
graduate students and one keynote speaker.
</p>

## Keynote Speaker

We are extremely excited to announce that the keynote talk is 
**Jonathan Aldrich** from Carnegie Mellon University.

## Call for Sponsorship

Most of our sponsorship funds are used to help students from around the United States afford to attend the workshop and get the most out of their experience, as well as to help facilitate interest broadly in programming languages research. We believe this commitment will pay dividends for our students, sponsors, and the public for years to come. If you’re interested in becoming a sponsor, we’d love to hear from you.
