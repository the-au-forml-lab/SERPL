## What

The Southeast Regional Programming Languages Seminar (SERPL) seeks to
bring together researchers in the Southeastern United States working in 
the design, analysis, and application of programming languages to build 
new collaborations among students and researchers.

We invite contributions in the form of student -- both undergraduate
and graduate -- research talks on topics related to programming
language research from theory to practice to interdisciplinary
applications.

SERPL consists of a full day of research talks from undergraduate and
graduate students and one keynote speaker.

We are extremely excited to announce that the keynote talk is

_Blocks Programming: A Rich Domain for PL Research_

> Blocks programming languages represent program syntax
  trees as compositions of visual code fragments. They are an
  increasingly popular way to introduce programming and
  computational thinking. Tens of millions of people have used
  blocks environments like Scratch, Snap!, MIT App Inventor,
  Blockly, Pencil Code, Alice/Looking Glass, AgentSheets/AgentCubes,
  and Code.org's curricula to learn programming and create
  computational artifacts for themselves, their families, and their
  communities. But blocks programming is not just for beginners;
  environments like GP and domain-specific blocks languages are
  targeted at hobbyists, scientists, artists, business people, and
  other casual programmers.

> Many members of the Programming Languages (PL) research community
  are either unaware of blocks languages or dismiss them as "just
  for kids" or "not real programming". As someone who spent many
  years working in the areas of functional programming, type
  systems, and semantics before focusing on blocks programming, I
  will argue that blocks languages are a rich domain for PL research
  that combines traditional PL topics with other usually
  underemphasized areas that should be more front-and-center in the
  PL research community, including usability, learnability, and
  computer science education. I will give examples of blocks
  language projects I've worked on with students in my TinkerBlocks
  research group at Wellesley College and with members of the MIT
  App Inventor group.

  There are several hotels near the GCC. Here are a few suggestions:

  - [Augusta Marriott at the Convention Center](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/agsmc-augusta-marriott-at-the-convention-center/?scid=bb1a189a-fec3-4d19-a255-54ba596febe2) - five minute walk to the GCC
  - [Holiday Inn Express Augusta Downtown](https://www.ihg.com/holidayinnexpress/hotels/us/en/augusta/agsdt/hoteldetail?cm_mmc=GoogleMaps-_-EX-_-US-_-AGSDT)

  The GCC is in downtown Augusta, where there are tons of restaurants, pubs, and bars within walking distance.

## Registration

Registration of all SERPL attendees is required, and can be completed by submitting the SERPL [registration form](https://forms.gle/RTbWGuTmwfYEiWKm6).

<!--
## Scope

SERPL scope is kept very broad in order to allow as many people to
  contribute as possible, but the following is an incomplete list of
  topics for SERPL related research:
  
  - Programming Language Design
  - Implementation aspects of programming languages
  - Software-Development Techniques
  - Foundations of Programming Languages
  - Software Analysis
  - Applications of programming languages
  - Domain-specific languages
  - Programming-language related education
        
  The previous list of topics is not comprehensive, and if your topic
  is not listed, then this should not prevent you from submitting your
  work.
-->

## Submission Instructions

Please submit in the form of a single PDF file a two page talk
abstract.  All submissions should be prepared using LaTeX using the
authors favorite style with a font size of no smaller than 11 points,
and a margin of no smaller than one inch.

All submission should be submitted via the [following form](https://forms.gle/CuiZa51ULMsyxmnT8).

There will be no formal proceedings, but all abstracts and slides
will be posted on the SERPL website.


## Travel Support

SERPL is graciously supported by the [National Science Foundation (NSF)](https://nsf.gov/).

  We are accepting applications for student travel support to SERPL: please [use this form](https://forms.gle/snpiUz3mMsreBgHP8).

  In addition, we have set aside a portion of our student travel
  awards for funding undergraduate students, women, underrepresented
  minorities, and LBGTQ+ people.

  Student travel grant applications can be submitted by filling out
  the form to come before April 10th. The application
  requires a letter from the students research supervisor asserting
  that the student has no other means of funding to attend SERPL.
