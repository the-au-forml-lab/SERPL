## What

The Southeast Regional Programming Languages Seminar (SERPL) seeks to
bring together researchers in the Southeastern United States working in 
the design, analysis, and application of programming languages to build 
new collaborations among students and researchers.

We invite contributions in the form of student -- both undergraduate
and graduate -- research talks on topics related to programming
language research from theory to practice to interdisciplinary
applications.

SERPL consists of a full day of research talks from undergraduate and
graduate students and one keynote speaker.

<!--
  We are extremely excited to announce that the keynote speaker is:

  [**Alexis King**](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/) : Research programmer at [Northwestern University
  PLT](https://plt.eecs.northwestern.edu/) in Chicago, Illinois.
  
  Supported by [Taxslayer](https://www.taxslayer.com/)

<!--
## Scope

SERPL scope is kept very broad in order to allow as many people to
  contribute as possible, but the following is an incomplete list of
  topics for SERPL related research:
  
  - Programming Language Design
  - Implementation aspects of programming languages
  - Software-Development Techniques
  - Foundations of Programming Languages
  - Software Analysis
  - Applications of programming languages
  - Domain-specific languages
  - Programming-language related education
        
  The previous list of topics is not comprehensive, and if your topic
  is not listed, then this should not prevent you from submitting your
  work.
-->

## Submissions

Please submit in the form of a single PDF file a two page talk
abstract.  All submissions should be prepared using LaTeX using the

## Travel Support

SERPL is graciously supported by the [National Science Foundation (NSF)](https://nsf.gov/).

  We are accepting applications for student travel support to SERPL.

  In addition, we have set aside a portion of our student travel
  awards for funding undergraduate students, women, underrepresented
  minorities, and LBGTQ+ people.

  Student travel grant applications can be submitted by filling out
  the form to come before April 10th. The application
  requires a letter from the students research supervisor asserting
