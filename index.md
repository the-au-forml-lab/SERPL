title: SERPL 2019 - The Southeast Regional Programming Languages Seminar
---

## What

SERPL is the Southeast Regional Programming Languages
  Seminar and seeks to bring together researchers in the design,
  analysis, and application of programming languages to build new
  collaborations among students and researchers in the southeast
  United States.  SERPL's program consists of a full day of research
  talks from student researchers at the undergraduate and graduate
  level, and is a venue for students to get feedback on their work
  before submission to a major conference.

  We are extremely excited to announce that the keynote speaker is:

  **Alexis King** : A principle developer of the [Racket
  language](https://racket-lang.org/) at Northwestern University in
  Chicago, Illinois.

## When

May 11, 2019

## Where

SERPL will be held in the [Georgia Cyber Center (GCC)]()
  the new home of the
  [Augusta University School of Computer and Cyber Sciences](https://www.augusta.edu/ccs).

  There are several hotels near the GCC, here are a few suggestions:

  - [Augusta Marriott at the Convention Center](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/agsmc-augusta-marriott-at-the-convention-center/?scid=bb1a189a-fec3-4d19-a255-54ba596febe2) - five minute walk to the GCC

  - [Holiday Inn Express Augusta Downtown](https://www.ihg.com/holidayinnexpress/hotels/us/en/augusta/agsdt/hoteldetail?cm_mmc=GoogleMaps-_-EX-_-US-_-AGSDT)

  The GCC is in the Augusta downtown, and there are tons of restaurants, pubs, and bars within walking distance.  

## Registration

Registration of all SERPL attendees is required
    and can be completed by submitting the SERPL [registration form](https://goo.gl/forms/Oeae43eUlqTYqTwi2).

## Scope

SERPL scope is kept very broad in order to allow as many people to
  contribute as possible, but the following is an incomplete list of
  topics for SERPL related research:
  
  - Programming Language Design
  - Implementation aspects of programming languages
  - Software-Development Techniques
  - Foundations of Programming Languages
  - Software Analysis
  - Applications of programming languages
  - Domain-specific languages
  - Programming-language related education
        
  The previous list of topics is not comprehensive, and if your topic
  is not listed, then this should not prevent you from submitting your
  work.

## Submissions

All of the important deadlines are as follows:

## Travel Support

SERPL is graciously supported by the [National Science Foundation (NSF)](https://nsf.gov/).

  We are accepting applications for student travel support to SERPL.

  In addition, we have set aside a portion of our student travel
  awards for funding undergraduate students, women, underrepresented
  minorities, and LBGTQ+ people.

  Student travel grant applications can be submitted by filling out
  the [student travel grant
