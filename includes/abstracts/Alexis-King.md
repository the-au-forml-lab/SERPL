Title: **Metaprogramming Haskell, The Racket Way**

Author: [Alexis King](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/resume.html)

Abstract: Racket programmers believe programs are best expressed in domain-specific languages, but most DSLs suffer from
impoverished programming models and poor tooling support. To remedy this, Racket provides an expressive macro system that
helps domain-specific languages compose and work together. The hundreds of little languages available to the Racket
programmer are evidence of the macro system’s success, but currently, almost none of them are statically typed. In this
talk, I’ll take a look at what makes that so hard by exploring what makes the Racket macro system special, and I’ll
present an approach that overcomes some of those obstacles to support a full-fledged Haskell dialect within a
macro-enabled language.
